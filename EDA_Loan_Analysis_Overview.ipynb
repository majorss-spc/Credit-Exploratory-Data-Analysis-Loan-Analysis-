    "- Loan providing companies face difficulty giving loans to people due to insufficient or no credit history.\n",

    "- Perform EDA to discover data patterns and ensure eligible applicants are not wrongly rejected.\n",

    "- If an applicant is **likely to default**, approving the loan causes **financial loss**.\n",
